                The tempus-fugit library is a small collection of classes and interfaces capturing common abstractions
                useful when writing concurrent and time sensitive code.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's hosted on Google Code at<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tempus-fugit/">
                http://code.google.com/p/tempus-fugit/</a>.
            </p>

                The best way to get a feel for what the library can offer is to have a look through the usage section of
                the site. You can also look through the source code and in particular the test code for examples.
